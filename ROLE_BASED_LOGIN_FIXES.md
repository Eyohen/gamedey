# ✅ Role-Based Login & Navigation Fixes

## Problem
When logging in as a facility owner or coach, users were being redirected to the user's explore page instead of their respective dashboards.

## Root Cause
The backend login endpoint (`/auth/login`) was not including the Coach and Facility associations in the user query, so the frontend couldn't detect whether a user was a coach or facility owner.

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Backend Changes**

#### AuthController.js (Line 87-159)
Updated the `loginUser` method to:
- Include Coach and Facility associations when querying the user
- Detect the user's role based on associations
- Add explicit `role` field to the response
- Generate tokens with appropriate user type

**Key Changes:**
```javascript
// Find user with Coach and Facility associations
const user = await User.findOne({
  where: { email },
  include: [
    { model: Coach, as: 'Coach', required: false },
    { model: Facility, as: 'ownedFacilities', required: false }
  ]
});

// Determine user type
let userType = 'user';
if (user.Coach) {
  userType = 'coach';
} else if (user.ownedFacilities && user.ownedFacilities.length > 0) {
  userType = 'facility';
}

// Add role to user object
const userData = user.toJSON();
userData.role = userType;
```

#### models/index.js (Line 87)
Added missing User → Coach association:
```javascript
User.hasOne(Coach, { foreignKey: 'userId', as: 'Coach' });
```

Fixed User → Facility association alias to lowercase:
```javascript
User.hasMany(Facility, { foreignKey: 'ownerId', as: 'ownedFacilities' });
```

### 2. **Frontend Changes**

#### Login.jsx
- Added comprehensive logging to track role detection
- Added 100ms delay before navigation to ensure state updates
- Uses `{ replace: true }` to prevent navigation issues

#### AuthContext.jsx
- Added logging when login is called
- Shows detected role and confirms state updates

#### ProtectedRoute.jsx
- Added detailed logging showing:
  - Current path being accessed
  - User's detected role
  - Allowed roles for the route
  - Why redirects are happening

## How It Works Now

### Login Flow:
1. User submits login credentials
2. Backend finds user with Coach/Facility associations
3. Backend determines role:
   - If user has `Coach` association → role: 'coach'
   - If user has `ownedFacilities` (length > 0) → role: 'facility'
   - Otherwise → role: 'user'
4. Backend returns user data with explicit `role` field
5. Frontend receives user data and calls AuthContext.login()
6. AuthContext detects role and stores it in state + localStorage
7. Login.jsx navigates to appropriate dashboard:
   - Coach → `/coach/dashboard`
   - Facility → `/facility/dashboard`
   - User → `/explore`

### Route Protection:
- Each route is wrapped with `<ProtectedRoute allowedRoles={[...]}>`
- ProtectedRoute checks if user's role matches allowed roles
- If role doesn't match, automatically redirects to user's appropriate dashboard

## Expected Behavior

### For Facility Owners:
- ✅ Login → Redirect to `/facility/dashboard`
- ✅ Can access all `/facility/*` routes
- ❌ Cannot access `/explore` or other user routes
- ❌ Cannot access `/coach/*` routes

### For Coaches:
- ✅ Login → Redirect to `/coach/dashboard`
- ✅ Can access all `/coach/*` routes
- ❌ Cannot access `/explore` or other user routes
- ❌ Cannot access `/facility/*` routes

### For Regular Users:
- ✅ Login → Redirect to `/explore`
- ✅ Can access all user routes (`/explore`, `/bookings`, `/profile`, etc.)
- ❌ Cannot access `/coach/*` routes
- ❌ Cannot access `/facility/*` routes

## Testing

### Console Logs to Check:
When you log in, you should see:
```
Detecting role for user: { ... }
Detected role: facility  (or coach, or user)
AuthContext.login called with userData: { ... }
AuthContext detected role: facility
AuthContext state updated with role: facility
Login successful, navigating to dashboard for role: facility
ProtectedRoute check: { path: "/facility/dashboard", userRole: "facility", ... }
Access granted to: /facility/dashboard
```

### If Something's Wrong:
1. Check console logs for role detection
2. Verify backend returns `role` field in login response
3. Check if Coach/Facility associations exist in database
4. Verify user has Coach record (for coaches) or ownedFacilities (for facility owners)

## Database Requirements

For role detection to work, your database must have:

### For Coaches:
- User record with email/password
- Coach record with `userId` matching the User's ID

### For Facility Owners:
- User record with email/password
- One or more Facility records with `ownerId` matching the User's ID

### For Regular Users:
- User record with email/password
- No Coach record
- No Facility records with matching ownerId

## Files Modified

### Backend:
- `gamedeyserver/controllers/AuthController.js` (loginUser method)
- `gamedeyserver/models/index.js` (User associations)

### Frontend:
- `gamedey/src/pages/shared/Login.jsx` (role detection & navigation)
- `gamedey/src/context/AuthContext.jsx` (logging)
- `gamedey/src/components/ProtectedRoute.jsx` (logging)

## Server Status
✅ Backend server restarted and running on port 3000
✅ All associations properly configured
✅ Database synchronized
